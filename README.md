# ZigDungeon

A port to Zig 0.16.0-dev and and rework in DOD/ECS style of a pre-0.15 zig OOP dungeon game made with Raylib by MrBSmith alias Babadesbois 💛

## Prerequisites

- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) (0.16.0)
- Git
- SSH key configured with GitHub eventually (for raylib notably)

## Getting Started

After having:
1. Cloned the repository and moved into its directory:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bsil78/ZigDungeon.git
   cd ZigDungeon
   ```

2. Set up raylib as a submodule:
   ```
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   ```

3. Built the project:
   ```
   zig build
   ```

### Build Options

| Option | Command | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Debug (default) | `zig build -Doptimize=Debug` | Build with debug symbols |
| Release | `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast` | Optimized release build |
| Strip symbols | `zig build -Dstrip=true` | Reduce binary size |

## Running the Game

After building, run the game using:
```
zig build run
```
